### üëã About Me

I am a detail-oriented VLSI Engineer combining hands-on experience in physical design and static timing analysis (STA) from my internship at **Intel** with a dedicated focus on advanced ASIC verification.

Recognizing the critical link between front-end design intent and back-end implementation, I have spent the last year intentionally upskilling my expertise in UVM and advanced verification methodologies. This strategic focus has allowed me to build a comprehensive, full-chip perspective. My goal is to leverage my unique understanding of STA and physical design to anticipate and solve complex verification challenges earlier in the development cycle. I am now seeking a verification role where I can apply this holistic skill set.

### üöÄ Project Portfolio

This portfolio showcases key projects completed during my focused upskilling in advanced ASIC verification. Each project demonstrates the practical application of modern, UVM-based methodologies and serves as a testament to the skills I've honed during my strategic transition into the verification domain.

#### UVM Verification of AXI4 Slave Interface
* Developed a layered UVM testbench in SystemVerilog for AXI4 slave verification.
* Implemented UVM agents, sequencers, drivers, and monitors for read and write channels.
* Generated constrained-random AXI sequences for protocol-valid burst transactions.
* Built a self-checking scoreboard with TLM analysis ports and incorporated SystemVerilog covergroups to monitor transaction-level coverage.
* *(Note: Full source code is being organized and will be uploaded shortly.)*

#### Functional Coverage Verification of Synchronous FIFO
* Constructed a parameterizable SystemVerilog testbench to verify FIFO functionality at multiple depths.
* Utilized UVM stimulus and monitoring for concurrent read and write operations.
* Defined covergroups and cross-coverage for key FIFO states and transitions.
* *(Note: Full source code is being organized and will be uploaded shortly.)*

#### Assertion-Based Verification of UART Transceiver
* Authored SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) for protocol checks, including start-bit detection, data sampling, and stop-bit timing.
* Established assertion-based monitors for automatic violation reporting during simulation.
* Implemented covergroups to track error conditions and control events.
* *(Note: Full source code is being organized and will be uploaded shortly.)*

#### **[Sequential Adder (UVM)](https://github.com/kothapallivamsikrishna/sequential-adder-uvm)**
* Demonstrates verification of a clocked, sequential design, including reset sequence management and timing-aware UVM components.

#### **[4:1 Multiplexer (UVM)](https://github.com/kothapallivamsikrishna/4-to-1-MUX-UVM)**
* A classic combinational logic project used to demonstrate a full UVM testbench with randomized stimulus and self-checking scoreboard.

#### **[Combinational Adder (UVM)](https://github.com/kothapallivamsikrishna/combinational-adder-uvm)**
* A foundational project demonstrating a complete UVM environment built from scratch to verify a simple 4-bit adder.
