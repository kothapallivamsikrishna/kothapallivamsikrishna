### üëã About Me

I am a highly motivated and detail-oriented VLSI Design graduate from VIT Vellore, specializing in ASIC verification. My experience includes developing robust UVM-based verification environments and implementing functional coverage and assertion-based strategies to ensure design correctness.

During a year-long internship at **Intel**, I gained hands-on experience automating design flows and performing static timing analysis. I have a proven ability to develop Python and TCL scripts to parse large-scale log files and have contributed to a production-level physical design flow using Synopsys ICC2. I am eager to apply my verification skills to contribute to cutting-edge projects.

### üöÄ Verification Projects

#### UVM Verification of AXI4 Slave Interface
* Developed a complete, layered UVM testbench in SystemVerilog for robust AXI4 slave verification.
* Implemented UVM agents, sequencers, drivers, and monitors for both read and write channels.
* Generated constrained-random AXI sequences to ensure protocol-valid burst transactions.
* Built a self-checking scoreboard using TLM analysis ports and incorporated SystemVerilog covergroups to monitor transaction-level coverage.

#### Functional Coverage Verification of Synchronous FIFO
* Constructed a parameterizable SystemVerilog testbench to verify FIFO functionality at multiple depths.
* Utilized UVM stimulus and monitoring for concurrent read/write operations.
* Defined covergroups and cross-coverage for key FIFO states (full, empty, half-full) and transitions.
* Applied Vivado code coverage analysis to identify untested RTL and systematically refine test stimuli.

#### Assertion-Based Verification of UART Transceiver
* Authored SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) for critical protocol checks, including start-bit detection, data sampling, and stop-bit timing.
* Established assertion-based monitors for automatic violation reporting during simulation.
* Implemented covergroups to track error conditions and control events for comprehensive verification.
